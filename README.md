# Explicit Shape Regression in Python
This repository contains an implementation of *Face Alignment by Explicit Shape Regression* by *Cao at al*.

To start reading the code, look at the *ExplicitShapeRegressor* class in *explicit_shape_regressor.py*,
which is the entrypoint to training the model. An example of training and testing the model is included in
the *example.ipynb* notebook.
